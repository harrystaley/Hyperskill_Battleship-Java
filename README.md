# Hyperskill_Battleship-Java

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic Battleship game. The project was developed as part of the Hyperskill learning platform, an interactive online platform designed to help users learn and practice programming. The game is a console-based application, where users can play against the computer.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. If you do not have it installed, you can download it from the official Oracle website.

To clone and run this application, you'll need Git and Java installed on your computer. From your command line:

## Usage

After running the application, you will be presented with a console interface. The game will guide you through the process of placing your ships on the game board. After that, the game starts. You will be prompted to enter the coordinates of the cell you want to hit on the opponent's board. The game continues until all the ships of one player are sunk.
